The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldnt have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible -- he had made the error not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one=sided stories so that they dont have to think.</td>\n",

A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first (yeah that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland) seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. There are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative) zombies (at one point I thought at least they didnt use zombies but they came) and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on getting in their way. There is also some time-shift doodle present but it adds up nothing to the storyline. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation but they never spell it out to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like: What happens will happen... or Light cant live in the darkness... or the ominous I need a red crayon... red crayon. So all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors and from or mistakenly to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up and if it seems a demon keyboardist cant spot a group of six people coming towards it waving a flashlight and conversing it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities. In the end we even get a it was all a dream sequence twist.

The plot was very simplistic and if done the right way could have been handled nicely but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reasons why this film wasnt that good was the poor dialog cheap laughs choppy directing and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. The acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says Ah you all look the same to me. I hate to admit it but I laughed out loud with that line. Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film as well not a way to end a career) and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capones relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching. The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture. In all honesty my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise youre better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.</td>\n",

An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne &amp; Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. Its based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesnt sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George Gabby Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10</td>\n",

Everyday items such as crates boxes metal containers etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects dart by Burtynskys camera. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them that is. Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynskys lens (but didnt we already know that from Wall-E?). He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places) with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape. Manufactured Landscapes a documentary about Burtynskys work has much of the feel of a Koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. Indeed director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China a dockyard in Bangladesh and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China. With their fluid camera-work the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynskys images. In fact the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best. But it is as a purely aesthetic experience highlighting image and form that Manufactured Landscapes resonates most.

In fact the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960s-70s television series like The Rat Patrol is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.  James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (Maverick Support Your Local Sheriff-Gunfighter etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwoods spaghetti western character. But Eastwoods stuff was not this flat and uninteresting. I suppose that A Man Called Sledge could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced Combat television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose.  The plot is the standard big heist thing (insert The War Wagon here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of Alias Smith and Jones with the same plot. The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewers interest. The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.  Then again what do I know? Im only a child.</td>\n",

Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman in between his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other. Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years scouting a location for a little filler film to get back into the flow of things. His role is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters among others one Scarlet the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale) currently sleeping with Scarlets lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek) and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a road trip that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other. It is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message.

The Isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldnt display emotion whatsoever. And when he tried to it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor playing Edward although its obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what Ive seen him do. Oh and the father wasnt half-bad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time I can hardly remember. The story itself was not very good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the ending which I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters with no real depth to them... Overall just not interesting or compelling nothing weve never seen before done MUCH better and nothing worth watching here. The ending is suppose to be a tearjerker. It did nothing of the sort. The ending isnt built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact I had to ask my friends WHY the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me I must have had a look on my face of Wait when did they say that? What?. Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst Ive seen though I do understand the fade-ins-fade-outs are done because this was originally made for TV but thats really no excuse. Overall the movie is just garbage. Im a sensitive guy I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap not even close. Really this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.</td>\n",

Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. At first making the serum was the easy part making the person come back was not. Most of the first tries ended up unstable. Until one night when he perfected the formula. And who else but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died so when he came to it was a close one. So when the did Caine he decided to use it for fun. Then when he got tired of being not seen the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. However the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should and Caine would delve into madness. So he ends up being one mad invisible killer. It would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. I would care less about the ones who did you wrong.

He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russells character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably wont. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shires delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcocks movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But sadly Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents.</td>\n",

The design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful.

The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive).

       "      <td>In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORDS HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and dont forget his first book SKETCHES BY BOZ was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that. But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees as I said is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a perfect scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh who also wrote funny books but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED DECLINE AND FALL and the rest. But in his determination to make his points if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too his falling did not go as far as Waughs did. Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear Bill in the score of SHOWBOAT it is not Kern and Hammersteins tune but Kern and Wodehouses tune transposed from Oh Lady Lady a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here. It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a friendly gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain occasionally from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Colliers attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest. Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WERE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence which includes the song Stiff Upper Lip is wonderful as is an earlier sequence where the three do a whisk broom dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracies marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiners mistake and looks at Gardiner as though hes either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)s son Reggie (Ray Noble the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too. The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role but the flaw is really Wodehouses - he didnt make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that given the other performers and their characters Gershwins music and Wodehouses marvelous sense of fun.</td>\n",

As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames Sir Alexander Kordas London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords &amp; sorcery it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script. Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief Sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed &amp; action. The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic &amp; sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when hes not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude. Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the films screen play &amp; dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of Jaffars accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. The film was begun in Britain but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction in vibrant Technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites &amp; pinks. ************************* Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysores stables when he was discovered by Kordas company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937 THE DRUM-1938 THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940 JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie Walt Disneys A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 only 39 years of age.</td>\n",

This cowardice and self-censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure. Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things. The lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his Northern-UK heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal. Apparently acknowledging the fact that Hitler was raised in a Catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of Vikings and their descendants by having Carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about Valhalla is quite okay. Well heres a clue for the writers - any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing. Until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason Hitler has never been excommunicated from the Catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach us. So now that weve managed to insult Vikings and the citizens of Scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt. Stockard Channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow-raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of Hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nanny-state fear of offending someone. It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilters character do not feature him at all. Until we learn to stop sugar-coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy (yes Germany was a democracy pre-Hitler) can occur anywhere we are doomed. Thats the one thing this mini-series got right in portraying. Unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make Hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter. David Lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series. They really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was written. All in all this politically correct farce of a bio-pic is worth no points but I gave it two because Robert Carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works.</td>\n",

Peter OToole as Ol Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. Its alright they have Col. Crickets full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes round for Christmas!) Still shes considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldnt come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: Ive only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we cant say they didnt warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They dont write em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey its just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. Thats the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when shes in love. Still Ill give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. Shes either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldnt tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldnt even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds shes lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (theres always a meanwhile) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I dont know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHEs going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama.</td>\n",

Although I am 17 I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly this movie does little justice to the series. The special effects are rather substandard and this wasnt helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4 Cat in the Hat Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. Now I will say I liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight. But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didnt seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and Elizabeth Hurleys character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and I liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly. Overall as much I wanted to like this movie I was left unimpressed. Instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox</td>\n",

What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.) I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 A Space Odyssey. WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. Whats important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story.

The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion. There seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that its really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Deans money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise. The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests. Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and LaurasJeff Morrow &amp; Marry Anderslittle pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond. The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until its revealed who the killer really is. We then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest. The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. Nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking. Theres everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S&amp;M sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder. You just couldnt care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do. Even the big surprise at the end isnt really that much of a surprise since the killers identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself! We then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is. The final plot-twist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes. First Blood Part II on the other hand is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambos massive chest. The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film that is - the novel didnt allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications. Of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambos work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible. To be honest First Blood Part II is a well-photographed and well-choreographed action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before. I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved.

Thats because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be quiet honest I appreciate the creativity of Voyagers episodes more than TNG. Voyagers episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyagers doctor -- now thats creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an organic inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface and even -- in the episode before Endgame to disobey Captains order and make human mistakes. Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality. Of course the rest of the Voyagers cast chemistry just flows effortless Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural. I love Tuvoc occasional humor despite being a Vulcan. Finally Im so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain. What a GREAT job!

       "      <td>Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is dull lifeless poorly acted and poorly scripted. Ive often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes. The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification. One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. Thats it. Thats the whole story. For most of the movie I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think this over. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the zombies revolted it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas. This is how I entertained myself throughout most of the movie. Im just glad I didnt buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and its a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what its worth Ill give it a 2/10. (I wont go to 1/10 because believe it or not Ive seen worse.)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test. I wont mince words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad? The answer is of course that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar. A serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home dont waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich.</td>\n",

       "4     The title says it all. Tail Gunner Joe was a tag given to the Senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft. The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldnt have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible -- he had made the error not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them.

       "19    OK this movie was cool. I dont think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard blow off the dust and pop it in. Enjoyable all the way until the end but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for Robot Jox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "28    Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact were Peckenpahs name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows in spades. The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming. And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess it seemed less written than made up as they went along. Its not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards.

       "29    There are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe but are overshadowed with bad acting plot holes deus ex machina thrown ins stupid dialogs weak script and predictable clichés... What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first (yeah that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland) seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. There are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative) zombies (at one point I thought at least they didnt use zombies but they came) and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on getting in their way. There is also some time-shift doodle present but it adds up nothing to the storyline. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation but they never spell it out to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like: What happens will happen... or Light cant live in the darkness... or the ominous I need a red crayon... red crayon. So all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors and from or mistakenly to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up and if it seems a demon keyboardist cant spot a group of six people coming towards it waving a flashlight and conversing it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities. In the end we even get a it was all a dream sequence twist. Or maybe it wasnt. Oh boy I wish this movie was and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "30    The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers career. The plot was very simplistic and if done the right way could have been handled nicely but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reasons why this film wasnt that good was the poor dialog cheap laughs choppy directing and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. The acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says Ah you all look the same to me. I hate to admit it but I laughed out loud with that line. Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film as well not a way to end a career) and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capones relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching. The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture. In all honesty my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise youre better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "36    John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah USA. An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. Its based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesnt sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George Gabby Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "50    Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least artful objects imaginable. Everyday items such as crates boxes metal containers etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects dart by Burtynskys camera. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them that is. Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynskys lens (but didnt we already know that from Wall-E?). He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places) with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape. Manufactured Landscapes a documentary about Burtynskys work has much of the feel of a Koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. Indeed director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China a dockyard in Bangladesh and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China. With their fluid camera-work the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynskys images. In fact the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best. But it is as a purely aesthetic experience highlighting image and form that Manufactured Landscapes resonates most. In the case of Burtynsky perhaps a picture really IS worth a thousand words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "54    Let me first state that I enjoy watching bad movies. Its funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovichs delusional ego doesnt just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben dead behind the eyes Sheets struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted trademark Mraovich that you cant possibly take any of them seriously. Arthurs brother Victor the bible toting Jesus freak is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. Thats because Sam multitasking Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like dominos pizza cold and usually wrong. The final tally: you suck at writing directing acting and casting. Thats the Ed Wood quadruple crown. Congratulations you horrible little man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "61    What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies Ive ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns....but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre. I still am wondering how the character Mark wasnt able to run away from the Clown...hes 300 pounds hes gotta get tired eventually. The whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud What did I just watch? Apparently Brandon is Denises cousin.... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin.....yeah thats something people want so see *shudders*. Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says What did you do? Well bytch what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch-hiker and calling her a c*nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence isnt helping anything....did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy? None of this movie makes sense anyway. The movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which I got sucked into buying (all 3.99)and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes. Im surprised the fat clown didnt join the orgy would have fit right in. I hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other B movies might have but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of garbage thats not even worth watching. 1 out of 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "73    Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. Script pacing and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields character as well as graphic deaths.  The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a childrens movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an Indian spiritual movie a travelogue and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon. That it manages to do just fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "76    When you look at this now and hear all the language in here its amazing this was rated PG but thats the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lords name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate them. The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: Falk Peter Boyle Allen Garfield Warren Oates Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino arent exactly actors you wouldnt find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist movies and a lot of films by director William Friedkin but this script doesnt deliver and it just has way too much of the Sleazy 70s feel to it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TVs Columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. This is far from the only case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "77    Although there are a lot of familiar television names associated with A Man Called Sledge there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960s-70s television series like The Rat Patrol is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.  James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (Maverick Support Your Local Sheriff-Gunfighter etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwoods spaghetti western character. But Eastwoods stuff was not this flat and uninteresting. I suppose that A Man Called Sledge could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced Combat television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose.  The plot is the standard big heist thing (insert The War Wagon here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of Alias Smith and Jones with the same plot. The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewers interest. The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.  Then again what do I know? Im only a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "80    Part of what was so great about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they werent afraid to do anything that they wanted. In this case Marvin the Martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling. Sure enough he comes across Bugs Bunny who warns of a mutiny on the part of Marvins dog. After Marvin finally traps Bugs - by means of an Acme strait jacket-ejecting bazooka! - Bugs has more stuff planned for the voyage back to Mars. What I mean is if you thought that it was a major change in the Solar System when they stripped Pluto of its planet status then you aint seen nothing yet! Yes The Hasty Hare goes all out. How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people but the point here - I mean hare - is to have fun. And believe me you definitely will. After all a little space-out never hurt anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "82    I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good. K-9 k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. The only downside is that i really didnt understand how Dooleys wife died. She died before this movie but how? If they said it i must have missed it. Other than that I give it two thumbs/tails up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had A lot of training. They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee would make when Dooley was talking to him was so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "92    This is one the few movies I can watch over and over. If youve never seen it give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly it reminds me of Julias untimely demise.

       "103   There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we dont meet these people anymore. We dont always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. Its funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we dont know do they. We are too afraid to check that out. The movie Before Sunrise just caught me watching it. I never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didnt know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "105   10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling just a little film shot in Carson CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman in between his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other. Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years scouting a location for a little filler film to get back into the flow of things. His role is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters among others one Scarlet the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale) currently sleeping with Scarlets lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek) and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a road trip that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other. It is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching informative and comic - a pleasure to view.

       "107   This is one of those movies - like Dave American Dreamer and Local Hero - that holds a viewers interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming its still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. True all the drama is melodrama; but thats entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: Now why cant I write sh*t like that? I think its unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "108   Another movie that relies upon the trite worn-out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder. The movie centers around a surgeon whose lifes ambition is to bring the dead...back to life. I know I know...youve never heard that one before! Of course as all of these movies go the experiment goes very very wrong and creates a maniacal bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup youd think that itd be at least a bit suspenseful. Wrong. Like many movies of this era the idea is nice but the execution and the script is mediocre. Not the worst horror movie Ive seen (no Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake)...but not one of the gems either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "110   Let me start off by saying that I didnt watch this movie at first with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and MTV was pasted on the front cover so I was not expecting much. What i was expecting was a tear-jerker overly dramatic but at least effective. I was wrong. Firstly let me start off that I had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie. The acting was my main gripe with the film. By god is it AWFUL. The main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast shes Maryl Streep. The main Hero Heath is just plain awful. He can sing decent sounding clichéd songs but thats about it. His acting broke the sad moments by being so bad at points that I just burst into laughter. The Isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldnt display emotion whatsoever. And when he tried to it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor playing Edward although its obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what Ive seen him do. Oh and the father wasnt half-bad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time I can hardly remember. The story itself was not very good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the ending which I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters with no real depth to them... Overall just not interesting or compelling nothing weve never seen before done MUCH better and nothing worth watching here. The ending is suppose to be a tearjerker. It did nothing of the sort. The ending isnt built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact I had to ask my friends WHY the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me I must have had a look on my face of Wait when did they say that? What?. Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst Ive seen though I do understand the fade-ins-fade-outs are done because this was originally made for TV but thats really no excuse. Overall the movie is just garbage. Im a sensitive guy I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap not even close. Really this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "117   Remember H.G. Wells The Invisible Man? Well heres another movie like it only more extreme. Hollow Man is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. At first making the serum was the easy part making the person come back was not. Most of the first tries ended up unstable. Until one night when he perfected the formula. And who else but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died so when he came to it was a close one. So when the did Caine he decided to use it for fun. Then when he got tired of being not seen the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. However the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should and Caine would delve into madness. So he ends up being one mad invisible killer. It would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. I would care less about the ones who did you wrong. Great movie plenty of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "119   Well well....Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didnt he? He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russells character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably wont. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shires delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcocks movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But sadly Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "127   Return to Cabin by the Lake does not in any way stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like but with much worse acting. Ive personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "128   In Die Nibelungen: Siegfried Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild seeks revenge. She marries Hagen and through a series of events finally engages in a very drastic (but fitting) action at the end. One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously it was not Fritz Langs fault that Hitler used The Nibelungenlied for German national pride in the Third Reich but one can see what the Fuhrer liked about the story. Nonetheless this is an absolutely formidable movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "131   Broken Bow takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk Spock and McCoy. This installment of the Star Trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since TOS to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of Going Where No Man Has Gone Before. Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer the first Captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer TPol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "138   I didnt enjoy this film. I thought the acting wasnt very good and the story was boring. A 20year old computer saving the day? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched even for a film. I couldnt figure out why they couldnt just turn it off why not take a sledgehammer to it. Its a shame but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film it wasnt. If that is what you want to watch do not watch this film!  Even if the old computer hadnt have turned up to save day this would still in my opinion be a very very cheesy flick..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "139   I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire there were numerous political and social messages the names make refer to some other names etc. It might be. I cannot realize such things (I dont want to do anyway) because I am not interested in I am interested in cinema. As for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we dont see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects. It was just shocking I could not pull myself together for a while because I had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old Gojira movies it was made in 2006 but it was not. It is like if you dont believe that there is a monster you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I dont want to compare The Host with other monster movies but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes I like Asian cinema too but this is the fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "147   Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee (a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent yet dull businessman Thierry Martin (a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold). Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive). Better still this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). The tartntangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. With his long scruffy black hair greasy mustache foul mouth and coarse manners Cages Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing romantic lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalees merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri Viveca Lindfors as Theirrys wise perceptive mother Tatta Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack and Steve Buscemi as a funny blithely shameless thief. Walt Lloyds sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. The flavorsome harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot. A delightfully campy and seamy riot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "148   This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit im surprised it got past the censors. Overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldnt be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider. A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash...

       "8350  This is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesnt turn out to be a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS THELMA AND LOUISE SHOWGIRLS FRISK and even a curious dash of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well-produced flick doesnt quite add up to anything. However the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8352  Good Lord what were they THINKING??!!!!!! Here is your spoiler warning even though I dont think itll really matter. You wont be seeing this piece of trash anyway. A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. In other words the whole thing is really stupid. You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots cant save something!! And they didnt! I know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign HIT and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang sad. All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8355  Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember this film being broadcast Halloween week back in 78 going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House. I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film. Later on repeat I saw I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises. Although I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8365  DOCTEUR PETIOT starring Michel Serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. The imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic intelligent and caring calculating and murderous. A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault for his chilling portrayal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8366  With the badly injured Tony in an induced coma two things happen: Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man. The dream sequences are right out of an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode as Tony finds himself transformed into an Average Joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed-up identities while on a cross-country business trip. His intonation as a blazer- and khaki-wearing schnook is more mid-American and less that of an Italian thug from Noo Joisey. A nice touch. The shockingly long-haired hippy-dippy AJ (whom Paulie calls Van Helsing at one point) has a nice scene with his comatose old man. The best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without Tony which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute. Vito gets off a line about the new-dead Gene possibly having been a closet case which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about Vito.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8373  This movie is great. If you enjoy watching B-class movies that is. This is a classic college 80s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. A horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives. Kinda funny if you ask me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8376  In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORDS HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and dont forget his first book SKETCHES BY BOZ was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that. But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees as I said is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a perfect scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh who also wrote funny books but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED DECLINE AND FALL and the rest. But in his determination to make his points if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too his falling did not go as far as Waughs did. Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear Bill in the score of SHOWBOAT it is not Kern and Hammersteins tune but Kern and Wodehouses tune transposed from Oh Lady Lady a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here. It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a friendly gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain occasionally from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Colliers attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest. Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WERE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence which includes the song Stiff Upper Lip is wonderful as is an earlier sequence where the three do a whisk broom dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracies marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiners mistake and looks at Gardiner as though hes either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)s son Reggie (Ray Noble the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too. The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role but the flaw is really Wodehouses - he didnt make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that given the other performers and their characters Gershwins music and Wodehouses marvelous sense of fun.   \n",
       "8380  Abu THE THIEF OF BAGDAD helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer. As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames Sir Alexander Kordas London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords & sorcery it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script. Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief Sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed & action. The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when hes not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude. Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the films screen play & dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of Jaffars accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. The film was begun in Britain but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction in vibrant Technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites & pinks. ************************* Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysores stables when he was discovered by Kordas company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937 THE DRUM-1938 THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940 JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie Walt Disneys A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 only 39 years of age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8381  This is not a good film. The acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing.The film doesnt seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route. I never saw the first film but this one doesnt stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire. Not worth the effort of watching                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8383  Advertised by channel seven in Australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event. This cowardice and self-censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure. Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things. The lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his Northern-UK heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal. Apparently acknowledging the fact that Hitler was raised in a Catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of Vikings and their descendants by having Carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about Valhalla is quite okay. Well heres a clue for the writers - any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing. Until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason Hitler has never been excommunicated from the Catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach us. So now that weve managed to insult Vikings and the citizens of Scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt. Stockard Channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow-raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of Hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nanny-state fear of offending someone. It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilters character do not feature him at all. Until we learn to stop sugar-coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy (yes Germany was a democracy pre-Hitler) can occur anywhere we are doomed. Thats the one thing this mini-series got right in portraying. Unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make Hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter. David Lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series. They really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was written. All in all this politically correct farce of a bio-pic is worth no points but I gave it two because Robert Carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8385  Okay you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) Shes killed off in the first scene - thats right folks; this show has no backbone! Peter OToole as Ol Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. Its alright they have Col. Crickets full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes round for Christmas!) Still shes considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldnt come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: Ive only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we cant say they didnt warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They dont write em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey its just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. Thats the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when shes in love. Still Ill give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. Shes either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldnt tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldnt even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds shes lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (theres always a meanwhile) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I dont know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHEs going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "8387  Protégé runs in a linear fashion; expect no fast-paced action and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments. There is not much of a crux so dont expect one either. I would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for Wus acting which was the films only saving grace. And oh that cute little girl too. The humour is at best weak and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families heroin drives you crazy it is not so easy to wean off you will fall into a vicious cycle. I know it may seem all a little harsh but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy (*SPOILER ALERT*: Take for example when Andy Lau got brought to the police station: what? we were just told oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997 and THAT is how he got caught. Nope no chasing-car action just a jump-of-scene which kind of undermined Wus role as an undercover in the first place.) I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean production film company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8400  This movie is bad news and Im really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this. I imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets you is that it could have been good. The directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a flop. The multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against any Italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork. He does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains...can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8405  Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been They Are They Will Be whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point. As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief although the less charitable may not do. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the teaser being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader seethes with menace as Ed Meecham. Forget Fearful Symmetrys dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "8419  I think that Elisabeth Rohm though she may try hard is not very good at all. I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick whose work I know very well. He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. When he wasnt on the screen the thing went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him the creeps. Ill watch anything with him in it but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person but no actress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "8420  This movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series that I am sure people do remember with fondness. Although I am 17 I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly this movie does little justice to the series. The special effects are rather substandard and this wasnt helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4 Cat in the Hat Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. Now I will say I liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight. But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didnt seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and Elizabeth Hurleys character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and I liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly. Overall as much I wanted to like this movie I was left unimpressed. Instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8424  I dont understand your objections to this movie. It is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in Basic Instinct. The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stones character is still alive and not in jail at this late date. SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stones character is killing all these people because shes crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stones character; 3) David Morrisseys analyst is killing these people for revenge. What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.) I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 A Space Odyssey. WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. Whats important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. Like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8427  ***SPOILERS*** With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean John Carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune some 140 million dollars. The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion. There seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that its really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Deans money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise. The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests. Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and LaurasJeff Morrow & Marry Anderslittle pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond. The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until its revealed who the killer really is. We then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest. The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. Nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking. Theres everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S&M sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder. You just couldnt care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do. Even the big surprise at the end isnt really that much of a surprise since the killers identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself! We then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is. The final plot-twist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "8428  Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why Id have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Full Moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate because without em this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasnt sure if Ms. Nipar hadnt wandered off an A-list picture onto this film she was very believable. No seriously! Anyway - its a shame they didnt have the bucks to license Dr. Strange because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "8452  This was an adorable movie. A real feel-good movie when you need one. The story is light (this is no Gone With the Wind) but sometimes one needs this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters fantastic acting and beautiful costumes/wardrobe. Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. All should keep an eye on her shes going to be BIG in the future. Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie. A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes. I was dancing throughout most of the movie. Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "8462  The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes. First Blood Part II on the other hand is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script which didnt do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambos massive chest. The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film that is - the novel didnt allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo never one to back down from a hard days violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications. Of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambos work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible. To be honest First Blood Part II is a well-photographed and well-choreographed action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before. I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesnt even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved. Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8463  (Review in English since Swedish is not allowed) I saw this movie with extremely low expectations and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them. As much as I loved to see Janne Loffe Karlsson on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water isnt original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that aint is just plain boring. I smiled like three times during the entire film. The placement of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny why not just a big sign saying; Findus made it happen!. Göta Kanal 2 doesnt need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD just wait for it to air on TV it wont take too long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8467  In a way this film reminded me of Jumping Jack Flash. Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredding machine? Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right? Thats how I feel about Rich In Love. A man hears his wife sing for the first time. Post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe. But theres only the whisper of a plot here and you cant wait for it to Get Moving. Only when ex-Go-Gos Charlotte Caffeys The Graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up...and then its over! This picture is the equivalent of a lazy summers day in the deep American South.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8468  I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution I am able to embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes. For those that dont really watch every single episode and know them by heart through TNG DS9 Voyager etc. general popular consensus will say -- I like The Next Generation the best. Thats because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be quiet honest I appreciate the creativity of Voyagers episodes more than TNG. Voyagers episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyagers doctor -- now thats creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an organic inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface and even -- in the episode before Endgame to disobey Captains order and make human mistakes. Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality. Of course the rest of the Voyagers cast chemistry just flows effortless Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural. I love Tuvoc occasional humor despite being a Vulcan. Finally Im so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain. What a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager I enjoy every episode the creative exploration of possibilities of morals and of our Cosmic expanse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8469  Unless you understand wretched excess this movie wont really mean much to you. An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it doesnt work. When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her. The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history. No one with the exception of Mikey Myers could be accused of acting; however he does an incredible job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "8489  Look theres nothing spectacularly offensive about this film its just boring. Its a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before youve seen so much as the trailer. The key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension. This movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment. The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago. Id recommend re-watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation. Oh one other BIG problem...no chemistry. If youre used to seeing Michael looking all cute as Vaughn in Alias youre going to be seriously disappointed with the way theyve made him look here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "8490  Watching The Fox and the Child was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals integrity of point of view and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure. The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless. I laughed. I wept. I learned. This is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes as if seen from the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel I have been privileged to watch--no to participate in--this film a work of true Art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "8493  Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is dull lifeless poorly acted and poorly scripted. Ive often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes. The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification. One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. Thats it. Thats the whole story. For most of the movie I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think this over. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the zombies revolted it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas. This is how I entertained myself throughout most of the movie. Im just glad I didnt buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and its a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what its worth Ill give it a 2/10. (I wont go to 1/10 because believe it or not Ive seen worse.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8494  Alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test. I wont mince words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad? The answer is of course that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar. A serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home dont waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldnt have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible -- he had made the error not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them.

An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne &amp; Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. Its based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesnt sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George Gabby Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10</td>\n",

He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russells character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably wont. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shires delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcocks movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst).

As for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we dont see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects. It was just shocking I could not pull myself together for a while because I had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old Gojira movies it was made in 2006 but it was not. It is like if you dont believe that there is a monster you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I dont want to compare The Host with other monster movies but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do.

Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive). Better still this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). The tartntangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. With his long scruffy black hair greasy mustache foul mouth and coarse manners Cages Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing romantic lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid.

What the heck? Its kinda funny how this movie is the 1970s version of Toy Story pretty much down to a key only this was a thousand times scarier Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room Raggedy Ann along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcellas birthday a new doll Babette arrives from Paris France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking runs over the edge of a cliff into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette",

While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasnt the worst movie I have ever seen I just dont know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was I have to admit Im glad I watched it sometimes you need a WTF?! movie to spice up your selection believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. Its official that doll is just plain creepy lets just put it this way theres a giant caramel river that is eating everything a king whos head keeps getting bigger as he laughs a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

When workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies they hire a con-artist (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them off. When his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of making him a Kung-Fu student the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well it turns out that while hes performing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that hes learning the skills to be a Kung-Fu expert! Its sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- Wax on wax off et cetera. Theres lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu tormentors. This time its not just tricks- its the real thing!

I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book Ive ever seen it would probably not have mattered. Im trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. Its not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel Im feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie; its more like some books just cant make the transition. Ms. Mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value. I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since Im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess Im writing this because I feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not. Im not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But its too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are.</td>\n",

It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly  it changed our world. However I cant not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry I am at the careless blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they?  To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think. Remember.

But to me I see this movie as much more than that. I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate: Thats ingenious - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrol? The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all - standing there almost naked. Yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work. Hes never really intimidated by people. Remember But Sidney we want to stop it too. Barely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again. Does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused? No. Also notable is Dapnes role. She is sick and tired of money and power. She thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company. At first she doesnt really care about Sidney anymore than anyone else. But that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. Shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for. The funny thing is that its not even romance. It is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit. Its more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. Upon her discovery that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp Sidney. Fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust. What a refreshment: Thank you Sidney. If you wouldve said yes I think Id have strangled you. I love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and Sidney goes off his stride matching the tune: dauntless. Where is Daphne? We dont really know - but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist. He got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope.

As in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with Leo who even though I liked his character I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men. This is in no way meant to bash gays (I am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. The only part of the movie I couldnt understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leos illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. I think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is DO NOT HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX!</td>\n",

It goes like this: A high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge sporting a Joker/Jester mask (pretty creepy looking might i add) Marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion. That is basically the plot? Whats wrong with that? Thats the beauty of 80s slasher films most of them i would say. A lot of things could be so ridiculous but they keep drawing you more in an in as they go by. Especially this film. It features some outrageous killings and some are quite creative as well. (poisoning of a beer can acid bath i cant remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either)It really is a fun fun movie. Thats all it is. Nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots never mind their stupidity and never mind the outrageous random things that occur in this film. Such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer (when hes not even switching any buttons youll see) and toilets being able to cough up blood baths being able to have acid come out of them just use that as part of your entertainment! Because thats what really makes it entertaining. Movies like this represent 80s slashers. Never again could movies like this get made know why? It isnt the 80s anymore. That is why you should just cherish them for what they are good fun! I highly recommend this film if youre a hardcore fan of Slahsers such as Friday the 13th. One last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well Marty Rantzen. A disfigured nerd who kills all his old foes in a creepy Jester mask. A good villain makes a good slasher. Simon Scuddamore who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. That alone adds something creepy to the film and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the Marty character i guess. All in all great 80s slashers fun!

Soon however Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats.

The story is about an expedition to Cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army. This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control rather than insatiable appetites. And quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too. The whole thing is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror there isnt any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this couldve provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. See it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise I would advise skipping this one.</td>\n",

The lone exception is Whats Up Doc? in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisands goofball protagonist -- and not coincidentally he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure!

Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her. Before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Childrens Play at a community theater. She gets caught and then realizes it is not her child. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. However in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victims parents feel sorry for her. A little while later Mom breaks into her mother-in-laws house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her (and feel sorry for her?). At another point in the story they have found the child but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world) she and the lawyer-boyfriend and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall. Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket. Of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock. The lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the Dad. At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico. On and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows! In some ways this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive.

This time out its Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isnt signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women hes been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys whos wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you dont like the character of Leon you wont like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes its really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isnt a lot of substance to this movie if you couldnt guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasnt good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasnt as bad as other SNL films but it wasnt as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character youll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you dont even bother going.

He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To put it plainer Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christines boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him. But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands who she all murdered. Now Reve and Christines boyfriend could be THE 4TH MAN. The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically this isnt my cup of tea. The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt. So in the very beginning you get to see Reves lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus theres a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined. Not that I have anything against shocking scenes but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole movie is revolved around the shock value.

You know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home - a huge rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the films end we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. Anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncles party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffes fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious. Also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldnt be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus.

       "      <td>Someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth. Offhand I can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout--Demon Seed Cube the remake of Thirteen Ghosts--but its at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt; its all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls. So I was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central. The idea is this: An architect has built--actually rebuilt--for himself a huge and rambling house; his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self-centeredness but also it is intimated because she cant get used to the place since he remodeled it. Living in unaccustomed solitude (real this time rather than virtual) he comes to suspect that somebody else--a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared--is living into the house with him; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him. This is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these: After searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure. Meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didnt foresee or doesnt remember. The movie would turn into a cat-and-mouse game a hunt a battle; and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didnt expect. Then he would be forced to think himself out of it--and maybe at the same time out of his own self-imposed isolation--and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the ****er. Nothing like this happens in this movie; the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all. Here is what does happen in the movie: Once the intruder is installed in the house--if he is--the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing. He calls the police they think hes slightly nuts; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks hes more nuts. At last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder (doesnt get a good look but figures who else could it be?--not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters) whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key (I dont know why he thought this necessary) and leaves his victim to starve. I missed why this was a given: the doors and walls are made of steel? In any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car. And since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place. And this is it: The architect--are you ready?--moves into the house of the man who (presumably) moved into his and lives there in the same way. How is this possible? It is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so: The architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him; and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like Martin their neighbor; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way. If this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in. The architect takes up residence with Martins wheelchair-ridden wife unbeknownst to her; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that hes able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around. Throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making (or leaving it to the viewer to make) the point that his life with this stranger who doesnt know hes there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer. But at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into Raffles the cat-burglar entirely incredible. Not to go into the series of twists at the end--including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door--this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair; two nice people who take murder in stride; and (before the story started) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses.... To the final long-anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then...ends. Here is a story that depends on the development of two things--the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is--and fumbles both. The first fumble makes it boring; the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one: Martin the tunnel-builder and sneak-tenant. The story should be redone by someone some day.</td>\n",

His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR THE TEN COMMANDENTS OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. This film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth  in 2022 that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called Soylent Green which is manufactured with Human flesh. This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes Indias population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it. Charlton Hestons character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism. Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message they deliver is not the Greens Party of todays ethos thank god. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in New Zealand  Fiji and Borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization. Another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made. The film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great Edward G. Robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons. This is a dud of a film and I wouldnt even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the USA in which an ecological disaster has occurred. The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.</td>\n",

First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didnt fit to this part at all since he doesnt look the intelligent/individualist type therefore he really couldnt play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great.

       "      <td>Samuel Fuller is hardly one of Americas great directors. Im not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywoods great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface its one more of Hollywoods early Fifties anti-Commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero Skip McCoy is a three-time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper Candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined. One of the most appealing characters Moe Williams is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywoods battle against Commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy.  Plus all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly. Its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us I mean introduced to us The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha  More than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the Feds and the Commies moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue with Fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. That muffin you grifted...shes okay one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability.  The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fullers talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- were going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us.  Says Glenn Erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics In what should be an inconsequential story Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it. As always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort. Hes right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aaron Spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film. It plays like a probable failed series pilot. Handsome Clint Walker is U.S. Marshal Dave Harmon who wanders into Yuma Arizona Territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive. Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a cute homeless Mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse. One night Andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in Army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him pinning the murder on Walker. Not good for your first twenty four hours on the job. Walker visits the local Army fort and rankles the chains of the commander. The bigwig hears of his brothers deaths and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well. The local native population who get short changed by the Army on their beef also get rankled in the chains area. With all these chains getting rankled Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The Army guy involved in the murder ends up dead the local cattle buyer is implicated the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as Walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along. There is a semi-subplot involving the death of Walkers family at the hands of Army raiders and I think this would have been the force behind the series had it been picked up. Instead the film ends abruptly and I kept waiting for scenes from next weeks exciting episode. Because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits. Walker is handsome rugged and has a voice deeper than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies. Much of the action is pretty lame and the violence is tepid. The first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect Reservoir Dogs but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns! Speaking of children the Mexican kid here goes from cute to aneurysm inducing annoyance very quickly. If you dislike westerns then you will dislike Yuma. If you like westerns then you will still dislike Yuma. I cannot recommend it. This is unrated but contains physical violence and gun violence.</td>\n",

Hes got a nice little pad in LA. I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver Jag (a series 1 E-type roadster) for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as Im sure other trinkets and boys toys). Theres always got to be more though hasnt there? So Harry lets himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (youre only as old as the woman youre feeling). As in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotch-less life leads to a downwards arc for Harry. Three blackmailers leech onto him. These are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles. Bobby Shy (played by Clarence Williams III) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. Hes reminiscent of Pluto the vicious black ex-con psychopath from Carl Franklins well-regarded neo-noir One False Move (1992). Theres a similar character motivation I believe. Both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis. Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). Hes in over his head and its great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown. John Glover wins as Alan Raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. Hes a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what I believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his RAP sheet readout its easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with Slim). In common with One False Move though not exclusively I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence. So far so good but I think theres a real problem with the film. Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer. My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider. Roy Scheider protagonists never lose theyre self-sure and smooth but not in an annoying way. I feel Im being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however I didnt believe it. For me its like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullocks character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or Stephen Seagals character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). Roy Scheider doesnt convince as an adulterer either you dont feel any annoyance with him at all his character is Teflon-coated. It also felt like a movie that took some cuts. At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: Harrys wife Ann Margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of Harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. The effect that the affair has on Harrys marriage isnt properly communicated. This could be a Frankenheimer problem hes not known for character development. I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS.  There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider). The film felt short even with the long running time and I think could have taken some more fleshing out. But you really cant forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour.</td>\n",

Corvette Summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like Vanishing Point or Dirty Mary Crazy Larry if lighter &amp; sexier than most. Just-graduated high-school automotive genius Kenneth (Hamill) hitchhikes to Vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his Shop Class masterpiece a super-custom right-hand-drive Vette. In the spiritual limbo of the I-15 desert (see Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas) he gets into a custom van (yes this was the tail end of the van craze too) tricked out as a mobile bordello &amp; driven by sassy aspiring hooker Vanessa (Potts) on her way to Sin City to make her well whatever it is ambitious hookers make. VANessa get it? Shy innocent Kenneth is in way over his head in Vegas with only his all-American resolve &amp; his new friend to help him although the hard-edged young call girl is predictably less world-wise than she first seems. Why in the I am Woman age Vanessa invested her talents money &amp; future in the worlds oldest but least dignified profession over say college or even hairdressing can be explained by young men whod like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path. Remember the target audience right? Hamill is a good choice for the whitebread Kenneth (the car doesnt even belong to him personally but to his school) who wont be deterred from his goal by violence money or even love--until he finds out why the car was really stolen. Potts acts with style &amp; energy but Vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into. The bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always-fine Brion James.

[1977]) which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the U.S. by K. Gordon Murray. Judging by those two efforts already mentioned Cardona was no visionary  and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better! The film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized Mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color (which in view of the prominence of reds  apart from St. Nick himself the Devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout was essential). Anyway in a nutshell the plot involves Satans efforts to stall Santa Claus Christmas Eve rendezvous with the Earths children; there is however plenty more wackiness along the way: to begin with our portly white-bearded and chronically merry man-in-red lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toy-maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing (laboriously for the whole first reel!) in their native tongue visits Merlin  the famed magician at King Arthurs court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child-like hopping and mumbling gibberish!  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible (by the way the Wizards anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of Dr. Frankenstein in SON OF Dracula [1974]!!); incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weight",
       "so Santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney! The Devils antics (enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up) to hold up St. Nicks delivery program then is perfectly puerile: indeed their tit-for-tat shenanigans resemble an old Laurel &amp; Hardy routine more than anything! To pad out the running-time we focus on three sets of children: one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for Christmas than their company (projected as a wish-fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra-large packages!) a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own (the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little ones dreams  to no avail) and a trio of brats who egged on once again by Satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves.

My grandparents were among its founders my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there now. (This doesnt have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.)  I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancée tells of me the good and happy place. If youve never experienced the lifestyle Indian Summer will probably be lost on you; dont bother. Its not quick-paced it doesnt have rapid cuts the plots arent in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there arent any A-list actors there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than perhaps Kimberley Williams killer line about how her fiancé shouldnt overwind his toys. That is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore. But Indian Summer is Godfathers polar opposite. If you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie. Dont read any more just do it. For me this is a 9/10 film.</td>\n",

She is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life I dont think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer. Its just all very silly. Another side note any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over. Priceless. FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks.

No exaggeration - thats the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up. That alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact its one of the best filmed WWII global dramas TV has ever produced.

Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision. Im a Boomer myself so dont think for a second Im some hubristic young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit. The Winds Of War could have been... so good. How much more would we be talking about this mini-series today some 25 years later had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important &amp; critical role? Right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.</td>\n",

This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers machine guns rifles handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they cant be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as its opening. The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers.

This movie however ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine LEngle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact Meg was based on Madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different.

One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas who cant wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies. Without a big budget for special effects CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. A bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale.

David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze.

So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey its just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. Thats the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when shes in love. Still Ill give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. Shes either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldnt tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldnt even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds shes lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (theres always a meanwhile) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I dont know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHEs going to find him there.)

       "4     The title says it all. Tail Gunner Joe was a tag given to the Senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft. The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldnt have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible -- he had made the error not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one=sided stories so that they dont have to think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "36    John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah USA. An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. Its based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesnt sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George Gabby Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "119   Well well....Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didnt he? He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russells character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably wont. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shires delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcocks movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But sadly Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "139   I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire there were numerous political and social messages the names make refer to some other names etc. It might be. I cannot realize such things (I dont want to do anyway) because I am not interested in I am interested in cinema. As for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we dont see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects. It was just shocking I could not pull myself together for a while because I had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old Gojira movies it was made in 2006 but it was not. It is like if you dont believe that there is a monster you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I dont want to compare The Host with other monster movies but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes I like Asian cinema too but this is the fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "147   Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee (a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent yet dull businessman Thierry Martin (a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold). Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive). Better still this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). The tartntangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. With his long scruffy black hair greasy mustache foul mouth and coarse manners Cages Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing romantic lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalees merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri Viveca Lindfors as Theirrys wise perceptive mother Tatta Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack and Steve Buscemi as a funny blithely shameless thief. Walt Lloyds sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. The flavorsome harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot. A delightfully campy and seamy riot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "159   Oh boy God bless the 1970s we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist Jaws The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Halloween and now Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world I mean seriously this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? Its kinda funny how this movie is the 1970s version of Toy Story pretty much down to a key only this was a thousand times scarier Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room Raggedy Ann along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcellas birthday a new doll Babette arrives from Paris France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking runs over the edge of a cliff into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette\n",
       " and believe me it just gets weirder from this point on. While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasnt the worst movie I have ever seen I just dont know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was I have to admit Im glad I watched it sometimes you need a WTF?! movie to spice up your selection believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. Its official that doll is just plain creepy lets just put it this way theres a giant caramel river that is eating everything a king whos head keeps getting bigger as he laughs a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

       "170   This movie is one of the many Kung Fu action films made in Asia in the late 70s - early 80s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action. But unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. When workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies they hire a con-artist (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them off. When his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of making him a Kung-Fu student the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well it turns out that while hes performing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that hes learning the skills to be a Kung-Fu expert! Its sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- Wax on wax off et cetera. Theres lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu tormentors. This time its not just tricks- its the real thing! Liu declares proudly thumping his chest.

       "244   I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on its own it was pretty boring. You never get a real good look at the maniac cops (Robert ZDar) face but what I did see was pretty grim. The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Directors Cut I may be more impressed. The ending with the car chase with ZDar Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "344   I dontknow... maybe its because Im Brazilian but all that stuff was too much. Too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on its not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything looks too fake to me: the families the relationships the music the happiness. It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. I must be honest: it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties? Im not that stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and STDs? I liked the scene with Caridads mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "379   Since starting to read the book this movie is based on Im having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book Ive ever seen it would probably not have mattered. Im trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. Its not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel Im feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie; its more like some books just cant make the transition. Ms. Mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value. I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since Im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess Im writing this because I feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not. Im not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But its too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "405   Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly  it changed our world. However I cant not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry I am at the careless blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they?  To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "415   Contains *spoilers* - also my quotes may not be exact. Everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true. But to me I see this movie as much more than that. I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate: Thats ingenious - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrol? The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all - standing there almost naked. Yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work. Hes never really intimidated by people. Remember But Sidney we want to stop it too. Barely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again. Does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused? No. Also notable is Dapnes role. She is sick and tired of money and power. She thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company. At first she doesnt really care about Sidney anymore than anyone else. But that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. Shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for. The funny thing is that its not even romance. It is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit. Its more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. Upon her discovery that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp Sidney. Fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust. What a refreshment: Thank you Sidney. If you wouldve said yes I think Id have strangled you. I love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and Sidney goes off his stride matching the tune: dauntless. Where is Daphne? We dont really know - but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist. He got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope. (Pollyanna) A contd relationship wouldve been nice but as Billy Joel says its more than Id hoped for...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "442   I saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault. As in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with Leo who even though I liked his character I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men. This is in no way meant to bash gays (I am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. The only part of the movie I couldnt understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leos illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. I think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is DO NOT HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "444   God Bless 80s slasher films. This is a fun fun movie. This is what slasher films are all about. Now Im not saying horror movies just slasher films. It goes like this: A high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge sporting a Joker/Jester mask (pretty creepy looking might i add) Marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion. That is basically the plot? Whats wrong with that? Thats the beauty of 80s slasher films most of them i would say. A lot of things could be so ridiculous but they keep drawing you more in an in as they go by. Especially this film. It features some outrageous killings and some are quite creative as well. (poisoning of a beer can acid bath i cant remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either)It really is a fun fun movie. Thats all it is. Nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots never mind their stupidity and never mind the outrageous random things that occur in this film. Such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer (when hes not even switching any buttons youll see) and toilets being able to cough up blood baths being able to have acid come out of them just use that as part of your entertainment! Because thats what really makes it entertaining. Movies like this represent 80s slashers. Never again could movies like this get made know why? It isnt the 80s anymore. That is why you should just cherish them for what they are good fun! I highly recommend this film if youre a hardcore fan of Slahsers such as Friday the 13th. One last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well Marty Rantzen. A disfigured nerd who kills all his old foes in a creepy Jester mask. A good villain makes a good slasher. Simon Scuddamore who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. That alone adds something creepy to the film and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the Marty character i guess. All in all great 80s slashers fun! Its a shame it will never be the same again...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "508   When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the dreadful Red Queen figurine I felt certain I was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise I loved it. Convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation. These quibbles apart however the film is a dream. Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He may not be Morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so. Really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference.

       "524   I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. I snuck downstairs really early one morning started watching HBO and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. This time around I still enjoyed The Raft although I couldnt tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. The other two segments were complete trash. I cant believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. All Ive accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics. 4/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "581   I have to say as being a fan of the man who created Halloween/The Fog/Christine/The Thing - probably his best films. Then you got this POS. I cant logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. You have to look at this from the standpoint that it didnt seem like a movie. It looked as if someone else directed it for one thing. I wont believe Carpenter put any effort into this at all. I was just listening to his old school H2/H3/The Fog soundtrack and it was awesome especially for the times. He was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "590   When you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old Amitabh Bachchan romances a 34-yr old Tabu. Wait! In fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of cheeni it is the content that is Kum in this Adman turned Writer-Director R. Balkis maiden effort.. Trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half. The locales of London as captured in rainy season are captivating. By the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished. There is not much left to be said. Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girls father to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how he gives in. The result second half is dry flat with no energy. There is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact. Nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "606   Yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time. Its so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the US. His worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? I have always been fascinated by the US government+media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon however Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. Were a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? If these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "658   Before the release of George Romeros genre-defining Night of the Living Dead zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table-manners in the old days. But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public? Judging by this film none whatsoever. The story is about an expedition to Cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army. This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control rather than insatiable appetites. And quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too. The whole thing is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror there isnt any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this couldve provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. See it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise I would advise skipping this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "707   One of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of Love Story; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. For me this movie rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Olivers father. But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings at least not for me. I may be a bit of a snob but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan ONeal -- I still havent seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them but not all are ruined for me by his presence. The lone exception is Whats Up Doc? in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisands goofball protagonist -- and not coincidentally he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure! McGraw and ONeal tend to mug their lines rather than act them. This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career: it was Tommy Lee Joness first movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "727   Im from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor sorry for that... This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10 thats pretty decent. I must admit that its a very well put together movie and thats why Im puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didnt make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha ;-)  Anyway I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please.....?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "779   Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film (so not really spoiler after all). Saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it. Its all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town. It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked. She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply. She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but thats another story which I dont remember too good. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked - cant be compared with the witch in Snowwhite who in comparison is easy to find out. Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "856   This movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a Mom (lisa Hartman Black) who acts like a man would in an action thriller. Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her. Before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Childrens Play at a community theater. She gets caught and then realizes it is not her child. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. However in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victims parents feel sorry for her. A little while later Mom breaks into her mother-in-laws house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her (and feel sorry for her?). At another point in the story they have found the child but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world) she and the lawyer-boyfriend and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall. Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket. Of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock. The lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the Dad. At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico. On and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows! In some ways this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive. On the other hand seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun (or funny?).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "865   Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands (Waynes World the first one not the second). But most often they have duds (Its Pat comes to mind rather quickly). This time out its Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isnt signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women hes been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys whos wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you dont like the character of Leon you wont like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes its really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isnt a lot of substance to this movie if you couldnt guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasnt good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasnt as bad as other SNL films but it wasnt as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character youll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you dont even bother going. Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "879   I first read Lorna Doone about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days journey from London and law and order was much harder to enforce. Sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values are OK but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful. Why do television adaptations do this? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story??? One of lifes great mysteries!!! The BBC made an excellent version which was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s which I am still trying to track down a copy of! Take my advice read the book and dont bother with this paltry version!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "895   I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go. This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next. The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve who has visions of his in-pending danger. He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To put it plainer Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christines boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him. But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands who she all murdered. Now Reve and Christines boyfriend could be THE 4TH MAN. The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically this isnt my cup of tea. The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt. So in the very beginning you get to see Reves lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus theres a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined. Not that I have anything against shocking scenes but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole movie is revolved around the shock value. So if any of this is your cup of tea watch this movie. Otherwise stay far far far far far away from this one. My mind is still scarred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "907   Italian horror/suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home - a huge rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the films end we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. Anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncles party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffes fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious. Also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldnt be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons. Cmon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "910   Someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth. Offhand I can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout--Demon Seed Cube the remake of Thirteen Ghosts--but its at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt; its all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls. So I was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central. The idea is this: An architect has built--actually rebuilt--for himself a huge and rambling house; his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self-centeredness but also it is intimated because she cant get used to the place since he remodeled it. Living in unaccustomed solitude (real this time rather than virtual) he comes to suspect that somebody else--a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared--is living into the house with him; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him. This is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these: After searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure. Meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didnt foresee or doesnt remember. The movie would turn into a cat-and-mouse game a hunt a battle; and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didnt expect. Then he would be forced to think himself out of it--and maybe at the same time out of his own self-imposed isolation--and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the ****er. Nothing like this happens in this movie; the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all. Here is what does happen in the movie: Once the intruder is installed in the house--if he is--the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing. He calls the police they think hes slightly nuts; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks hes more nuts. At last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder (doesnt get a good look but figures who else could it be?--not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters) whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key (I dont know why he thought this necessary) and leaves his victim to starve. I missed why this was a given: the doors and walls are made of steel? In any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car. And since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place. And this is it: The architect--are you ready?--moves into the house of the man who (presumably) moved into his and lives there in the same way. How is this possible? It is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so: The architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him; and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like Martin their neighbor; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way. If this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in. The architect takes up residence with Martins wheelchair-ridden wife unbeknownst to her; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that hes able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around. Throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making (or leaving it to the viewer to make) the point that his life with this stranger who doesnt know hes there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer. But at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into Raffles the cat-burglar entirely incredible. Not to go into the series of twists at the end--including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door--this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair; two nice people who take murder in stride; and (before the story started) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses.... To the final long-anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then...ends. Here is a story that depends on the development of two things--the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is--and fumbles both. The first fumble makes it boring; the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one: Martin the tunnel-builder and sneak-tenant. The story should be redone by someone some day.   \n",

       "7710  Its time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one. His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR THE TEN COMMANDENTS OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. This film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth  in 2022 that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called Soylent Green which is manufactured with Human flesh. This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes Indias population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it. Charlton Hestons character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism. Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message they deliver is not the Greens Party of todays ethos thank god. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in New Zealand  Fiji and Borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization. Another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made. The film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great Edward G. Robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons. This is a dud of a film and I wouldnt even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the USA in which an ecological disaster has occurred. The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "7716  First off the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasnt anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didnt fit to this part at all since he doesnt look the intelligent/individualist type therefore he really couldnt play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally I think he wasnt mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we lesser mortals. 5/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "7742  The first (and only) time I saw Shades was during a Sneakpreview. It hadnt even been in premiere. I remember there was someone of the directors staff there dont even remember who. It was a Belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and hes stands miles ahead all the rest. He plays an actor whos star has long stopped rising. Hes helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled Shades. As soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is. Nothing against the occasional swear word. However this was way beyond annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the F*** word to express something it comes naturally. However when someone from the cast a non-English speaker uses the F**** or S*** word it becomes arrogant and aggressive. We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words. Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre. And we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the -10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "7771  I want to state first that I am a Christian (and that I do work in the film and TV industry) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard. Im all for positive uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things dont always work out ... even for followers of Christ). Im glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face. A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes exposition aplenty and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across. Im sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well. Maybe they could direct someone elses screenplay as their next project. * Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one (Hoosiers Field of Dreams etc) can inspire in a multitude of ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires give Steven Soderberghs King of the Hill a look.

       "7783  Samuel Fuller is hardly one of Americas great directors. Im not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywoods great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface its one more of Hollywoods early Fifties anti-Commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero Skip McCoy is a three-time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper Candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined. One of the most appealing characters Moe Williams is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywoods battle against Commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy.  Plus all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly. Its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us I mean introduced to us The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha  More than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the Feds and the Commies moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue with Fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. That muffin you grifted...shes okay one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability.  The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fullers talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- were going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us.  Says Glenn Erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics In what should be an inconsequential story Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it. As always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort. Hes right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "7792  Aaron Spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film. It plays like a probable failed series pilot. Handsome Clint Walker is U.S. Marshal Dave Harmon who wanders into Yuma Arizona Territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive. Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a cute homeless Mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse. One night Andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in Army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him pinning the murder on Walker. Not good for your first twenty four hours on the job. Walker visits the local Army fort and rankles the chains of the commander. The bigwig hears of his brothers deaths and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well. The local native population who get short changed by the Army on their beef also get rankled in the chains area. With all these chains getting rankled Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The Army guy involved in the murder ends up dead the local cattle buyer is implicated the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as Walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along. There is a semi-subplot involving the death of Walkers family at the hands of Army raiders and I think this would have been the force behind the series had it been picked up. Instead the film ends abruptly and I kept waiting for scenes from next weeks exciting episode. Because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits. Walker is handsome rugged and has a voice deeper than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies. Much of the action is pretty lame and the violence is tepid. The first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect Reservoir Dogs but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns! Speaking of children the Mexican kid here goes from cute to aneurysm inducing annoyance very quickly. If you dislike westerns then you will dislike Yuma. If you like westerns then you will still dislike Yuma. I cannot recommend it.

       "7818  The film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show its what you expect. Its not a bad movie; its actually pretty good. If you dont like the show dont see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny. There are even a few heart-wrenching scenes toward the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his shows existience. Hes got a pretty good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV too. If they were celebrities we wouldnt mind at all wed eat it up. Do we not like his guest doing this just because theyre poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a Leave it to Beaver world?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "7828  Found this flick in a videostore it cost $2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk. He nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel which makes sense given the old mans inability to DO anything worth mentioning a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over in what must have been some sort of story. I got lost a hundred times but didnt mind because the movie is so bad its real fun to watch. Zero-Budget trash with actors not deserving that name. Go check it out!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "7872  I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was of the tender age of 6 my brother 4 then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It wasnt just the movie but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many christians about the mark of the beastand the rapture. This movie the church and a volatile neglectful upbringing lead to severe paranoia towards the future. For years I lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Went through years of counseling. I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. I was pegged with a delusional disorder. I actually began to believe this it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future I have come to terms with the fear injected into its members by the church.

       "7925  Lifes going not to badly for Harry Mitchell hes an ex-air force major (plus nifty little pension I imagine) whos raking in the cash for a patent hes developed (fusing titanium and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for NASA) and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick. Hes got a nice little pad in LA. I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver Jag (a series 1 E-type roadster) for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as Im sure other trinkets and boys toys). Theres always got to be more though hasnt there? So Harry lets himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (youre only as old as the woman youre feeling). As in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotch-less life leads to a downwards arc for Harry. Three blackmailers leech onto him. These are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles. Bobby Shy (played by Clarence Williams III) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. Hes reminiscent of Pluto the vicious black ex-con psychopath from Carl Franklins well-regarded neo-noir One False Move (1992). Theres a similar character motivation I believe. Both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis. Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). Hes in over his head and its great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown. John Glover wins as Alan Raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. Hes a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what I believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his RAP sheet readout its easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with Slim). In common with One False Move though not exclusively I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence. So far so good but I think theres a real problem with the film. Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer. My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider. Roy Scheider protagonists never lose theyre self-sure and smooth but not in an annoying way. I feel Im being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however I didnt believe it. For me its like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullocks character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or Stephen Seagals character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). Roy Scheider doesnt convince as an adulterer either you dont feel any annoyance with him at all his character is Teflon-coated. It also felt like a movie that took some cuts. At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: Harrys wife Ann Margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of Harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. The effect that the affair has on Harrys marriage isnt properly communicated. This could be a Frankenheimer problem hes not known for character development. I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS.  There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider). The film felt short even with the long running time and I think could have taken some more fleshing out. But you really cant forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7937  The summer of 1979 when this flick was a staple on that new movie medium called HBO was Gas Line Summer & Iranian Hostage Crisis Summer. A change of mood was about to end low-budget loner-on-a-mission car films although Smokey & the Bandit kept need-for-speed flicks going as live-action Roadrunner cartoons for a few more years. Corvette Summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like Vanishing Point or Dirty Mary Crazy Larry if lighter & sexier than most. Just-graduated high-school automotive genius Kenneth (Hamill) hitchhikes to Vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his Shop Class masterpiece a super-custom right-hand-drive Vette. In the spiritual limbo of the I-15 desert (see Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas) he gets into a custom van (yes this was the tail end of the van craze too) tricked out as a mobile bordello & driven by sassy aspiring hooker Vanessa (Potts) on her way to Sin City to make her well whatever it is ambitious hookers make. VANessa get it? Shy innocent Kenneth is in way over his head in Vegas with only his all-American resolve & his new friend to help him although the hard-edged young call girl is predictably less world-wise than she first seems. Why in the I am Woman age Vanessa invested her talents money & future in the worlds oldest but least dignified profession over say college or even hairdressing can be explained by young men whod like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path. Remember the target audience right? Hamill is a good choice for the whitebread Kenneth (the car doesnt even belong to him personally but to his school) who wont be deterred from his goal by violence money or even love--until he finds out why the car was really stolen. Potts acts with style & energy but Vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into. The bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always-fine Brion James. But theres not much action & this isnt the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog plot twists or Heavy Themes. You could always reach up turn the TV dial & plug in your Pong console. The similar but meaner Chris Mitchum vehicle Stingray which appeared at about the same time featured lamer acting but more skin speed & mayhem. The best features of each film might have produced a Vette movie worth remembering. Thus the Trans Am was left to rule the box-office muscle car showroom. Another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by Speed Channels fine weekend series Lost Drive-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "7952  This was another obscure Christmas-related title a low-budget Mexican production from exploitation film-maker Cardona (NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES [1969] TINTORERA! [1977]) which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the U.S. by K. Gordon Murray. Judging by those two efforts already mentioned Cardona was no visionary  and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better! The film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized Mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color (which in view of the prominence of reds  apart from St. Nick himself the Devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout was essential). Anyway in a nutshell the plot involves Satans efforts to stall Santa Claus Christmas Eve rendezvous with the Earths children; there is however plenty more wackiness along the way: to begin with our portly white-bearded and chronically merry man-in-red lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toy-maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing (laboriously for the whole first reel!) in their native tongue visits Merlin  the famed magician at King Arthurs court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child-like hopping and mumbling gibberish!  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible (by the way the Wizards anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of Dr. Frankenstein in SON OF Dracula [1974]!!); incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weight\n",
       "so Santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney! The Devils antics (enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up) to hold up St. Nicks delivery program then is perfectly puerile: indeed their tit-for-tat shenanigans resemble an old Laurel & Hardy routine more than anything! To pad out the running-time we focus on three sets of children: one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for Christmas than their company (projected as a wish-fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra-large packages!) a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own (the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little ones dreams  to no avail) and a trio of brats who egged on once again by Satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves. There is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment (unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure) well at bay!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "7994  Although this is generally a cheesy jungle-adventure movie it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good. You wont be bored watching it. Keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghaid into escorting rich boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife Shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country. He never takes things seriously . Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of her - she doesnt really have to act much. Shes not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a T/A picture. Theres nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it. Produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss.

       "8001  There is this private campground in Plymouth Massachusetts thats been around since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there now. (This doesnt have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.)  I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancée tells of me the good and happy place. If youve never experienced the lifestyle Indian Summer will probably be lost on you; dont bother. Its not quick-paced it doesnt have rapid cuts the plots arent in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there arent any A-list actors there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than perhaps Kimberley Williams killer line about how her fiancé shouldnt overwind his toys. That is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore. But Indian Summer is Godfathers polar opposite. If you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie. Dont read any more just do it. For me this is a 9/10 film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8052  Its getting worse the series is on a serious down fall. The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast cant act. The story is Alice having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again.

       "8079  The film was okay quite entertaining. The cast was pretty good and Ill second what the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played the selfish evil friend and manager of the band brilliantly! There are a lot of songs performed by Beyond Gravity in this film but this doesnt really come as a surprise considering the film is a VH1 production. However if the soft rock/ pop music isnt to someones liking one might as well flash forward those scenes. The plot of a band trying to make it to the top in L.A. but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isnt too original but quite entertaining with some surprising plot turns here and there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8081  Actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part and its much worse than other MJ movies like The Wiz Captain Eo and Ghosts. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years (Yeah thats half my life you guys!) I cant complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie its not good at all and Im afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling Mike hadnt been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "8091  I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again but with different actors and a little bit different plot. I will say the cars in the film are very cool. So if you like fast cars then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because Ive seen her from Days of our Lives. She is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life I dont think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer. Its just all very silly. Another side note any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over. Priceless. FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks. So if you like fast cars then Id recommend this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8109  A wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue! No exaggeration - thats the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up. That alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact its one of the best filmed WWII global dramas TV has ever produced. If you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance.  Im stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the film with their eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision. Im a Boomer myself so dont think for a second Im some hubristic young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit. The Winds Of War could have been... so good. How much more would we be talking about this mini-series today some 25 years later had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role? Right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8156  I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers machine guns rifles handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they cant be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as its opening. The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this film. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8172  First of all I am a huge fan of Madeleine LEngle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books A Wrinkle in Time. This movie however ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine LEngle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact Meg was based on Madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine LEngle and her Wrinkle in Time series I would suggest skipping this movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "8181  Gritty dusty western from director Richard Brooks who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman) a suave gambler (James Coburn) a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part) this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Coopers era). Good-looking if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8202  Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie and it wasnt even worth that. It seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain I am guessing. Neagle - despite her glory awards and reputation - is a homely British gal who cant sing or dance or act. Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagles husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was mistaken. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here. Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8256  The arch title doesnt fit this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake dont have much chemistry -- but their characters arent supposed to. Both are extremely likable and attractive. The supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of Sig Rumans annoying faux Russian.

       "8273  William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire. One tale is the old retread of The Hook two teens on lovers lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas who cant wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies. Without a big budget for special effects CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. A bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale. The acting is understandably not award worthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton Courtney Ballard H. Ray York Johnny Tamblyn Walter Kaufmann Kevin Draine David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8316  The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. Id forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8320  Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series strung together without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict fighting and a resolution where all are happy in the end) and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled in (over the closing credits!) without explanation and everything is just a bit too sweet. Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your childs world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon and by my showing an interest in what they like we are closer. Seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience. I gave the movie a 4 mostly from my childrens point of view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8355  Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember this film being broadcast Halloween week back in 78 going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House. I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film. Later on repeat I saw I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises. Although I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.

       "8385  Okay you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) Shes killed off in the first scene - thats right folks; this show has no backbone! Peter OToole as Ol Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. Its alright they have Col. Crickets full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes round for Christmas!) Still shes considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldnt come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: Ive only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we cant say they didnt warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They dont write em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey its just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. Thats the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when shes in love. Still Ill give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. Shes either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldnt tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldnt even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds shes lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (theres always a meanwhile) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I dont know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHEs going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8419  I think that Elisabeth Rohm though she may try hard is not very good at all. I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick whose work I know very well. He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. When he wasnt on the screen the thing went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him the creeps. Ill watch anything with him in it but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person but no actress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
